// A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there 
// may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into 
// the water.

// Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the 
// frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on 
// the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

// If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 
// units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

// Note:
// The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
// Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
// The first stone's position is always 0.

// Example 1:
// [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
// There are a total of 8 stones.
// The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
// third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
// The last stone at the 17th unit.
// Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
// 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
// 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
// 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

// Example 2:
// [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
// Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
// the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

// it's not a good solution to use dp, better to use dfs
